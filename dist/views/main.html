  <h1 class="page-header">Vision</h1>
  <p>Students and scholars in the humanities generally rely on prefabricated tools to guide and instruct their research and are reluctant to engage with computers and technology through coding. This remains a major distinction between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences design, create and maintain their own relevant digital research enviornments and tools, while the humanities make do with prefabricated, and often inappropriate, tools. </p>

  <p>At the moment, there are no broadly available academic programming courses aimed at humanities scholars. However, coding skills are needed more now than ever, and even more so in the future: </p>

  <ol>
    <li>They help students and researchers to understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying. </li>
    <li>Developing custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality) of its output.</li>
    <li>There is an ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for academics who can read and write code.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>At the same time there is a development towards online academic education. Currently this is mainly in the form of MOOCs, which focus on massive numbers of students who can participate in these courses. There is a reasonable fear, however, that the lack of individual feedback and direct interaction in those courses will lead to a decay of quality of education and scholarship. We believe, however, that a different, more creative use of online teaching and learning environments can actually help us educate both larger numbers of students as well as give more attention to the individual student. We call this approach "online first". It combines an interactive, dynamic teaching and learning environment with large Q&A sessions and smaller peer-feedback groups.</p>
  
  <p>Programming also offers opportunities for new kinds of collaborative work. Larger research projects no longer need to be divided into several topics or objects, but people can divide labor through different tasks and skill sets, using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship. The various research techniques that can be explored programmatically include: parsing, visualization, mapping, interfacing, searching, computation, translation, and linking. This kind of large scale collaborative projects will make the humanities more attractive for external funding.</p>
  
  <p>The kind of humanities teaching that we propose will give the UvA Humanities Faculty a unique profile, which will not only lead to innovative forms of humanities research but also make our students more employable. It will also provide a test-bed for innovative new forms of on-line learning developed specifically for the needs of humanities teaching and learning. The proposed course, with its corresponding learning and teaching environment, is the first step in achieving this vision. </p>
